# Tree Views

> **Status:** evolving

Tree Views (`src/extension.ts` — `MultiSessionTreeProvider` inner class, and
`src/pi-packages-tree-provider.ts` — `PiPackagesTreeProvider`) are the two
sidebar tree views in the Pi Code Gui activity bar: **Sessions** and **Packages**.
They provide VS Code-native UI for browsing, managing, and interacting with chat
sessions and Pi packages.

## Why they exist

The tree views are the primary navigation surface beyond the chat panel itself.
Without them, users would need to manage sessions via file system or command
palette, and package management would require terminal commands. The tree views
make session browsing, forking, deletion, and package install/update/uninstall
accessible through VS Code's standard sidebar UX.

## Sessions tree (`MultiSessionTreeProvider`)

A two-section tree:

**Open Sessions** — each open `SessionWindow` appears as a tree item showing:
- Session label with `●`/`○` streaming indicator
- Model and thinking level as a description
- Expandable to show: Model picker, Thinking picker, Entries header
- Entries header expands to show individual messages (user, assistant, custom)
  with context menu actions: Reveal in Chat, Copy Text, Fork from Message

**Past Sessions** — persisted `.jsonl` files on disk, loaded via
`PiService.listSessions()`. Filterable by text content. Context menu: Resume,
Fork, Delete. Bulk delete-all available.

Key design decisions:
- Expand/collapse state is tracked and preserved across refreshes
- Past sessions are loaded asynchronously with a refresh-only mode
- Tree items carry `command.arguments` for context menu action routing
- The active session is tracked independently for command targeting

## Packages tree (`PiPackagesTreeProvider`)

A two-section tree:

**Installed** — packages from `.pi/` config, each expandable to show:
- Description, badges (version, license, downloads, publisher), keywords, links
  (npm, repo, homepage)
- Actions: Uninstall, Update (if available)

**Marketplace** — search results from npm registry filtered for Pi packages
(`pi-` prefix, pi-related keywords). Each item expandable with the same
overview format plus an Install action with scope picker.

Key design decisions:
- Marketplace search is debounced (2s minimum) with result caching
- Banner images fetched from GitHub READMEs in background
- Update availability checked via `checkForUpdates()` on refresh
- Installed packages enriched with marketplace metadata for richer display
